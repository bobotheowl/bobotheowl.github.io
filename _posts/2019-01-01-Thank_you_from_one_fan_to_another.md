I started reading LO about 8 months ago, and was increasingly compelled to write about it, but found no reasonable outlet until r/Lore_Olympus started. I only just started this blog. Nonetheless, in a mere few months I have accumulated 5,000 karma on Reddit. Now I realize that is not "porn star" karma, but considering that I was a total neophyte when I started, and the only place I post is r/lore_olympus, I'm very grateful to have so many people enjoy my past-time with me.

As far the future go, I am going to decrease my postings to r/lore_olympus, but post as frequently on the blog. I will continue to post to r/lore_olympus, with links to the blog, but I don't want to be spammy which I felt I was drifting that way once I also had the blog going. The point was never to become a karma monger, or to build my own profile/portfolio. I'm just having fun, and I hope you are, too.

If I haven't posted a link, and *you* want to post to reddit or anywhere else for that matter, ***please do***! If you do, please drop me a line letting me know, and I will create and out link to that site, or at least check in on the discussion. Notifications are nice but certainly not necessary.

For the next couple of months, I expect to have a *daily* text message. Let me know if you have some ideas or characters you'd like to see in the, text messages, [drop me a line](emailto:bobotheowl@protonmail.com). Feedback is always appreciated.  I hope to have the comments up and running soon, too.

As always, see you in the funny pages.

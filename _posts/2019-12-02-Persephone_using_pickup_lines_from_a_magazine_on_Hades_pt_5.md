<p>
It seems not everyone is familiar with the fine art of really, really, just
awful pick-up lines, so here are the three Persephone is stringing together
(usually told by a boy hitting on a girl).
</p>

<p>
"Boy: You like my shirt? It's made out of boyfriend material."
</p>

<p>
"Boy: You like my shirt? You can wear it tomorrow morning."
</p>

<p>
"Boy: I love your shirt/pants it will look even better on my bedroom floor."
</p>

<p>
These, like all pick-up lines, are primarily used by boys...because
men don't need pickup lines.

<hr> 

I like to think that Persephone believes she *has* to be lewd to get Hades' attention, but it is to antithetical to her nature, and Hades just isn't having it, either. He *knows* what these things mean, but while he desires Persephone in every way a man can desire a woman, he simply cannot contextualize what Persephone as saying anything so common as pickup lines.

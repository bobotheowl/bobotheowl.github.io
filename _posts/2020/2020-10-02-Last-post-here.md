# Last post here

All, this will be the last post here. It turns out that github isn't very easy to maintain, all things considered. I mostly started this particular site to learn about a service I no longer intend to use, even out this context. **Never Fear!!**

My library can now be found at [https://bobotheowl.tumblr.com](https://bobotheowl.tumblr.com). it is up and running, as of this publication, and I will continue to put all of the text messages there.

I will deactivate this site at the end of 2020.

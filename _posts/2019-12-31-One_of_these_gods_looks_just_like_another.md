![Athena sure reminds me of someone](/assets/img/kindred-spirits.png)

This the second of two conversations. [Go to the first
conversation.](/_posts/2019-12-30-Some-people-have-suspicious-similarites.md)

I must confess that the original idea that either Athena or Hades might be Hades bastard sprung from a comment on the WebToon page, but the comments there are essentially unsearchable, and I did not note at the time who noticed that Athena looks exactly like Hades. I *think* given the image where Hades and Athena are right next to one another it's possible that Rachel Smythe is setting up that reveal, later on.

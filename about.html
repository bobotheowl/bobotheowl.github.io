<p>I am Bobo Glaukon, a loyal servant of Athena for lo, these many years. Though I serve Athena well, I am mortal and confined to the mortal realm. I, as with all mortals, must await dispatches from high Olympus to know the doings of the gods. This site is my repository for my analysis an contributions to the wider fanon.</p>
